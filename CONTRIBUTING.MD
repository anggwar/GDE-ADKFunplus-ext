# Contributing to CeritaNenek Workshop 👵🏻

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the CeritaNenek workshop! This repo is designed for educational purposes, and we love seeing how students and developers remix the "Nenek" persona.

## 🤝 Ways to Contribute

### 1. Share your "Power Persona"
Did you modify `agent.py` to create a funny, sad, or unique version of the grandmother? Maybe a "Grandpa" or a "Gen Z" version?
1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  Create a folder inside `community_agents/` named after your agent (e.g., `community_agents/gen_z_nenek/`).
3.  Add your `agent.py` and instructions there.
4.  Submit a **Pull Request (PR)**.

### 2. Report Bugs
If a step in the Codelab is unclear, or a command fails:
* Please check existing [Issues](../../issues) first.
* Open a new Issue describing the error and your environment (Cloud Shell vs Local).

## ⚠️ Important Guidelines

* **NO SECRETS:** Never commit your `.env` file or expose your API Keys (Vertex AI / Gemini API keys).
* **Be Respectful:** Ensure your Agent Personas follow [Google's Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy).

Happy coding! ✨
